### Tasks
    1. We need to refactor the player.isValid method so that false case does not repeat inputs

    2. To fix the issue we the 'isWin' and 'isLose' not working as intended. We will create two methods that will reference the player and computerPlayer separately. The 'isWin' and 'isLose' we reference these methods.
