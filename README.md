### Tasks
    1: We need to import a file that contains a document which represnts a dictionary. We will read the file, then store the words in a dictionary.

    2: We need to create a class called Player. Since we are mixing ES5 and ES6, we need to make sure that the Player class is able to extend from the Board class.
